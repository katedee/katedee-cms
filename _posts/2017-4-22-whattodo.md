<p>Comic based on Sierra DeMulder’s poem <em>&#8220;What to Do After You Have Memorized the Face of the Person You Love&#8221;</em> from the collection of her poetry,<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bones-Below-Sierra-DeMulder/dp/0984251537">the Bones Below</a></em> (click and buy the book!).<br />
Sierra DeMulder is one of my favourite poets, and I really loved the sweetness of this poem and wanted to do a comic with the text.</p>
<p>Words are all Sierra DeMulder’s.<br />
Drawings are my own.</p>
