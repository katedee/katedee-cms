In January of 2016, I began a relationship that would ultimately become highly abusive. It lasted four months. Four Months is a series of comics that documents some of those moments, and the hurt and healing that followed.

This comic reflects on my outlook, one year out of the relationship.

For what it's worth, therapy helped me come a long way. Reading books like _"The Body Keeps the Score"_ helped me to understand and normalize a lot of what I was feeling. If you are suffering from trauma, I highly recommend that book, and practicing yoga, which aides in processing ptsd (there are plenty of free yoga resources online, feel free to reach to me.
