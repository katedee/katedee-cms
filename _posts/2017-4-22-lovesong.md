Personal work, inspired by the Ted Hughes poem "Lovesong"

The poem is a very beautiful piece, but incredibly bleak, bitter, and angry. And yet, under all that, there is a tone of affection to it. The couple do seem to love each other, but their relationship is incredibly dysfunctional.<br />
The poem and the relationship is complex, and that’s why I’m so drawn to it.

You can google to read the poem, OR, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnKhh-ZvnhM">click here</a> and listen to a beautiful recording of it.
