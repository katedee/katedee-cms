Becoming is 31 page horror comic, written and drawn by me. 

Becoming is a story of repression, denial of self, and how that presents itself in our lives. Laila is a woman who lives alone with her past, haunted by a ghastly figure living in her mirror. The reflection calls to Lailaâ€™s unacknowledged history, begging her to confront her denied history.
